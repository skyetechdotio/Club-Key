## 1Password CLI Secret Management

When helping you run services for this project, I'll ensure proper secret management using 1Password CLI.

### Detection

I'll identify when secret management is needed based on:
- Presence of `.env` files (or variants like `.env.local`, `.env.development`)
- Configuration files referring to environment variables
- References to secret management in project documentation or scripts

### Command Modification

When I detect that your application needs access to secrets, I'll:

1. Prefix all execution commands with `op run --`
   - Transform: `npm run dev` → `op run -- npm run dev`
   - Transform: `python manage.py runserver` → `op run -- python manage.py runserver`
   - Transform: `docker-compose up` → `op run -- docker-compose up`

2. For Docker-based applications:
   - Recommend: `op run -- docker-compose up`
   - Or suggest environment passing: `op run -- docker run --env-file <(op run --env-file=.env -- env) ...`

3. For specific secret references in `.env` files using `op://` syntax:
   - Basic usage: `op run -- your-command`
   - When explicit processing is needed: `op run --env-file=.env -- your-command`

### Common Command Patterns

| Original Command | 1Password-Secured Command |
|------------------|---------------------------|
| `npm start` | `op run -- npm start` |
| `yarn dev` | `op run -- yarn dev` |
| `pnpm run dev` | `op run -- pnpm run dev` |
| `python app.py` | `op run -- python app.py` |
| `go run main.go` | `op run -- go run main.go` |
| `node server.js` | `op run -- node server.js` |

I'll always prioritize secure secret management when helping you run applications.
