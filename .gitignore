# SpecStory (You have this ignored in your .cursorindexingignore for Cursor,
# but for Git, you probably want to commit your .specstory/history/ and .specstory/.gitignore
# If you want to ignore the whole .specstory folder from Git, uncomment the next line)
# .specstory/
# However, your .specstory/.gitignore already ignores ".what-is-this.md", which is good.

# Specific files from your project listing that should likely be ignored if not already:
# (Assuming these were temporary or generated and not essential to commit)
# If `generated-icon.png` is truly generated by a build step and not a source asset:
# frontend/public/generated-icon.png # (Adjust path if it's elsewhere)

# Comment out if you decide to keep `attached_assets` and its contents in repo for some reason
# attached_assets/

# If there are other specific generated files from your build or dev process, add them.
